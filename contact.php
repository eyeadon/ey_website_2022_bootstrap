		<h3>Bio</h3>
		<p>Evan Yeadon is a visual communicator who is constantly influenced by the environments that surround him. A native of rural Massachusetts, landscapes controlled by nature are a great subject for the artist's study of form. The influence of the modern American city is also seen in his compositions that reflect order, geometry, and pattern. His ideas start with a sketch, a collage of photos or a palette of colors. Next the combination of traditional drawing and digital graphics link together to create a design.</p> 
		<p>Evan holds a B.F.A. in Industrial Design and a Certificate in Web Development. He has a broad range of experience working in a variety of design offices. Specializing in graphic design and web development, he finds innovative solutions that build a strong brand image. Evan has developed identities for human resources/benefits departments, insurance brokerages, and health management programs. His latest work includes the development of WordPress websites.</p>
