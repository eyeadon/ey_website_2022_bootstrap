<p>Today’s Flat Track Roller Derby movement was formed in 2003 by the Austin Texas Rollergirls. There are now more than 300 Flat Track Derby leagues worldwide, with more forming every week. In its current incarnation, Roller Derby is a genuine athletic competition complete with well-defined rules, divisions, tournaments, and a governing body: the Women’s Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA).<br />
<br />

The Texas Rollergirls are 100% skater-owned and managed. Their league is composed of four home teams supported by a loyal, enthusiastic fan base: Hell Marys, Hotrod Honeys, Honky Tonk Heartbreakers, and Hustlers. A fifth team, the Texecutioners, is comprised of all-star members from each of the four home teams. In 2006, the Texecutioners were crowned the WFTDA Champions of the first Flat Track National Tournament.<br />
<br />

Also in 2006, Pioneer Valley Roller Derby of Northampton, MA formed an all-mens team named the Dirty Dozen. The "Dozen" actively practices with Pioneer Valley's womens team, the Western Mass Destruction. In 2007 the Men's Roller Derby Association (MRDA) was created to cultivate new mens leagues. Today there are 20+ mens teams registered with the MRDA across the country.
