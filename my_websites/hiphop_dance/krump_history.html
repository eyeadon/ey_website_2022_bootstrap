    <h2>Krump History</h2>
    <p>Krump was first danced by Tight Eyez and Big Mijo of South Central, Los Angeles in the early 2000's. It is an acronym for "Kingdom Radically Uplifted Mighty Praise". It started as a faith-based dance that is an interaction with God. Krump was created as an expressive dance that allows the dancer to have a conversation with God. Krumpers express what they feel. Their dance is not harmful to any of God's teachings. Dancers are encouraged to communicate in an appropriate way. </p>
  <h3>How Dancers Move</h3>    
  <p>Krump is a high energy, aggressive dance that encourages participants to not hold anything back. Krumpers are known to "go dumb" or lose themselves in a fit of wild movement. The best Krumpers have great control over their body. They are able to express themselves in an awesome display of their art.</p> 
  <p>Krump became a new Hip Hop culture that the everyday kid could enjoy. Dancers are not focused on how much money people have or what car they drive. They can concentrate on the benefits they receive from the experience of Krump. It is important for people to come together and learn from each other.</p>
  <p>Krump's basic moves include arm swings, chest pops and stomps. It is an improvisational dance like Turf. These two dance styles share their street origins, freestyle performances and competing in battles.</p>
  <h3>What's Happening</h3>    
    
  <p>A "call-out" is a move a dancer makes when he/she means to initiate a battle with another dancer. It is a flamboyant dash or tease of the opponent. A "kill-off" is an ending move of a routine that is done to overpower the competition. Dancers use their best combinations of moves when they kill-off.</p>
